As part of my Advanced Java course, I developed a multi-client chat application using JavaFX and Socket programming. 
I built a server-client architecture over TCP/IP, implementing multithreading to ensure that multiple users can message each other simultaneously without any blocking or lag. 
The entire workflow, from server setup to private messaging, is fully GUI-based. This project gave me hands-on experience in managing concurrent connections, stream-based data transfer, and handling network-related exceptions. 
Developed as a 2-person group project, our work was highly successful, earning a perfect 100% score for its stability and design.
